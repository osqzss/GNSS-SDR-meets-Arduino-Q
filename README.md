# GNSS-SDR real-time positioning on Arduino UNO Q  
### with integrated GNSS-SDR Web Monitor (Node.js)

This repository presents an embedded application of **GNSS-SDR** running in real time on the **Arduino UNO Q** platform. The system demonstrates GPS positioning using a compact, low-power Linux device, combined with web-based control and embedded visualization.

---

## Overview

The **Arduino UNO Q** runs a Debian-based Linux distribution, which enables native installation of **GNU Radio** and **GNSS-SDR**. The complete GNSS-SDR software stack is built directly on the target following the official GNSS-SDR build and installation instructions provided by the GNSS-SDR project.

In its current configuration, the receiver supports **GPS L1 C/A only**. Multi-constellation operation (e.g., Galileo) is not yet enabled due to computational and memory constraints of the platform.

The system integrates:

- Real-time GNSS-SDR processing  
- A Node.js web server for remote control  
- A Python interface for data extraction  
- An STM32F0 microcontroller driving an LED matrix for live visualization  

---

## Hardware setup

The hardware configuration used in this project consists of:

- **Arduino UNO Q**  
  - Linux host (Debian-based)  
  - STM32F0 microcontroller  
- **RTL-SDR front-end**  
  - Nooelec NESDR SmarTee SDR  
- **Active GNSS antenna**  
- **LED matrix display** driven by the STM32F0 MCU

## System architecture

The application follows a modular architecture that separates GNSS processing, control, and visualization tasks.

**Figure 2 – High-level system architecture**

Main components:

- **GNSS-SDR** running on Linux, processing live RF samples  
- **Node.js web server** for starting/stopping the receiver and selecting configurations  
- **Python interface script** extracting GNSS-SDR outputs  
- **STM32F0 microcontroller** receiving navigation data and driving the LED matrix

## GNSS processing configuration

Real-time GNSS processing is performed using the following configuration:

- **Constellation:** GPS  
- **Signal:** GPS L1 C/A  
- **Number of tracking channels:** 7  
- **Coherent integration time:** 4 ms  
- **Front-end:** RTL-SDR (live RF input)  

The receiver computes standard GNSS outputs in real time, including:

- GPS observables  
- Carrier-to-noise density ratio (**C/N₀**)  
- Position, Velocity, and Time (**PVT**) solution  

Galileo signal processing is currently not enabled due to platform resource limitations.

## Web-based control interface

A **Node.js-based web server** runs on the Linux side of the Arduino UNO Q and provides a browser-accessible interface to control GNSS-SDR execution.

The web interface allows the user to:

- Start and stop the GNSS-SDR receiver  
- Select between different GNSS-SDR configuration files  
  - Offline / post-processing configuration  
  - Real-time configuration using RTL-SDR  

Selected GNSS-SDR outputs (observables, C/N₀, and PVT) are exposed for monitoring and downstream processing.

### GNSS-SDR config path

The Node.js server resolves GNSS-SDR config files from an environment variable first, falling back to the current user's home directory:

```
GNSS_SDR_HOME=/home/arduino/gnss-sdr
```

If `GNSS_SDR_HOME` is not set, it defaults to `~/<user>/gnss-sdr` via the OS user home.

## Embedded LED matrix visualization

A dedicated **Python script** extracts relevant GNSS-SDR outputs and forwards them to the **STM32F0 microcontroller** on the Arduino UNO Q.

The microcontroller drives an **LED matrix display**, providing real-time visualization of receiver status and navigation parameters.

Currently visualized information includes:

- Satellite signal strength indicators (C/N₀)  
- Receiver activity and status  
- PVT-related information  

**Figure 4 – LED matrix visualization of C/N₀**

**Figure 5 – LED matrix visualization of PVT information**

The LED matrix provides a compact, color-coded visualization of key PVT parameters:

- **Red:** A binary clock indicating the number of tracked satellites. The most significant bit is the leftmost LED.
- **Purple:** A conventional PVT status indicator. It blinks when no solution is available, remains steadily lit at low intensity for a 2D fix, and steadily lit at higher intensity for a 3D fix.
- **Yellow:** C/N₀ bar indicators for up to seven satellites.
- **Green:** Position and velocity representation. Within this square, a dot moves in the corresponding direction of motion; its displacement increases or decreases proportionally with the platform’s speed.
